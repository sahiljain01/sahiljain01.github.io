	<p >Hi :) I'm a computer scientist with a particular appreciation for <br> 
	low-level systems programming, AI engineering, and time-series data. <br><br>
	I'm currently a developer at Citadel, where I work in Global Fixed Income &amp Macro in NYC.
	I've also worked on High Performance Computing at Citadel Securities, ML/AI Infra at Nuro,
	and developer experience tooling at Salesforce. I studied at Princeton University and grew up
	in the Bay Area.<br><br>
	In my free time, I play basketball, follow the markets, and cheer on
	the 49ers.<br><br> I also really enjoy meeting new people, especially if a cup
	of coffee is involved.</p>
